# Kubernetes Architecture

**What is Kubernetes?**

> an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications

**The Borg Heritage**

Kubernetes was build by Google to replace an old app administraitor called `Borg`

- **Control Manager**: cp, master node or control pane manage core container configs for minion nodes and keeps the state of the cluster of minions
  - kube-controller-manager
  - kuber-scheduler
  - kube-apiserver
  - kubelet
  - kube-proxy
  - etcd
  - cloud-controller-manager (if applicable)
- **Worker Nodes**: they manage conainer resourses
  - kubelet
  - containerd
  - kube-proxy
  - iptables/eBPF

**Pod**: consists of one or more containers which share an IP address, access to storage and namespace.

Typically, one container in a Pod runs an application, while other containers support the primary application.

**Operators or Controllers**: interrogates the kube-apiserver for a particular object state, modifying the object until the declared state matches the current state.

**Deployment**: Defaulft operator for containers.
Deploys and manage a different operator called ReplicaSet.

**ReplicaSet**: Operator which deploys pods, each with the same spec information. These are called replicas.

**CronJobs or Jobs**: Operator to handle single or recurring tasks, or custom resourse definitions and purpose-built operators

**DaemonSet**: ensure a single pod is deployed on every node. these are used for mehttps://d36ai2hkxl16us.cloudfront.net/course-uploads/e0df7fbf-a057-42af-8a1f-590912be5460/dovkeccu43i9-NewPodNetwork.pngtrics, logging or security pods.

**StatefulSet**: can be used to deploy pod in order, for example deploy **first a database pod** and wait until this is up, **then run a web-server pod** that depends on the availability of the database.

**Labels**: used to manage thousands of pods across multiple nodes. these are arbitrary strings which become part of the object metadata. Use tags to change the state of selected group objects without knowing their individual names or UIDs.

**Taint**: arbitrary string in the node metadata, to inform the scheduler on Pod assignments used along with toleration in Pod metadata, indicating it should be scheduled on a node with the particular taint.

**Annotations**: remain with the object, but cannot be used as a selector; however, they could be leveraged by other objects or Pods.

**Namespace**: A segregation of resources, upon which resource quotas and permissions can be applied. Kubernetes objects may be created in a namespace or cluster-scoped. Users can be limited by the object verbs allowed per namespace. Also the LimitRange admission controller constrains resource usage in that namespace. Two objects cannot have the same Name value in the same namespace.

**Context**: A combination of user, cluster name and namespace. A convenient way to switch between combinations of permissions and restrictions. For example you may have a development cluster and a production cluster, or may be part of both the operations and architecture namespaces. This information is referenced from `~/.kube/config.`

**Resource Limits**: A way to limit the amount of resources consumed by a pod, or to request a minimum amount of resources reserved, but not necessarily consumed, by a pod. Limits can also be set per-namespaces, which have priority over those in the PodSpec.

**Pod Security Policies**: Deprecated. Was a policy to limit the ability of pods to elevate permissions or modify the node upon which they are scheduled. replaced by Pod Security Admission.

**Pod Security Admission**: A beta feature to restrict pod behavior in an easy-to-implement and easy-to-understand manner, applied at the namespace level when a pod is created. These will leverage three profiles: Privileged, Baseline, and Restricted policies.

**Network Policies**: The ability to have an inside-the-cluster firewall. Ingress and Egress traffic can be limited according to namespaces and labels as well as typical network traffic characteristics.

## Master Node Components:

**kube-apiserver:** Core operation of the K8s cluster.
All calls, both internal and external traffic, are handled by this agent. **Each API call goes through three steps: authentication, authorization, and several admission controllers.**

**kuber-scheduler**: uses an algorithm to determine which node will host a Pod of containers. The scheduler will try to view available resources (such as available CPU) to bind, and then assign the Pod based on availability and success. The scheduler uses pod-count by default, but complex configuration is often done if cluster-wide metrics are collected.

**etcd Database**: The state of the cluster, networking, and other persistent information is kept in an etcd database, or, more accurately, a b+tree key-value store. Rather than finding and changing an entry, values are always appended to the end. Previous copies of the data are then marked for future removal by a compaction process. It works with curl and other HTTP libraries, and provides reliable watch queries.

**kube-controller-manager**: is a core control loop daemon which interacts with the kube-apiserver to determine the state of the cluster. If the state does not match, the manager will contact the necessary controller to match the desired state. There are several controllers in use, such as endpoints, namespace, and replication. The full list has expanded as Kubernetes has matured.

## Worker Nodes:

> All worker nodes run the kubelet and kube-proxy, as well as the container engine, such as containerd or cri-o. Other management daemons are deployed to watch these agents or provide services not yet included with Kubernetes.

Ensures access to:

- Storage
- Secrets
- ConfigMaps

**kube-proxy**: is in charge of managing the network connectivity to the containers.

Pods can be created by using a generator:

`$ kubectl run newpod --image=nginx --generator=run-pod/v1`

or using JSON or YAML

`$ kubectl create -f newpod.yaml`

`$ kubectl delete -f newpod.yaml`

## Services

Each Service is a microservice handling a particular bit of traffic, such as a single NodePort or a LoadBalancer to distribute inbound requests among many Pods.

A service, as well as kubectl, uses a selector in order to know which objects to connect. There are two selectors currently supported:

- **equality-based**:
  Filters by label keys and their values. Three operators can be used, such as `=` , `==` , and `!=` . If multiple values or keys are used, all must be included for a match.
- **set-based**:
  Filters according to a set of values. The operators are `in`, `notin`, and `exists`. For example, the use of status notin (dev, test, maint) would select resources with the key of status which did not have a value of dev, test, nor maint.

**TODO** what DeltaFIFO is
